## New

(kept current after every merge; player words only)

- When a cutscene runs slowly, the game now saves one picture from it and a copy of the log in a file called `slow-` and the date, in the logs folder, once each time you start it. If you report a slow cutscene, attach that file with the log.

## Fixed

(kept current after every merge; player words only)

- The next picture no longer waits for the screen before it starts drawing, on phones and with vsync on: cutscenes on slower phones run smoother.
- On Snapdragon (Adreno) graphics chips, Turnip included, the game now checks every drawing of the characters in every picture for the fault that made Yorda flicker, and saves a picture and a small file beside the log by itself the first time it sees it. No setting to change.
